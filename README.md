# Advent of code 2022

## Day 1
Picked R as a language. Code in `puzzle1.R`, input data in `puzzle_input_1.txt`.
Code assumes packages **readr** and **purrr** are installed.

```R
install.packages(c("readr", "purrr"))
```

## Day 2
Picked R as a language. Code in `puzzle2.R`, input data in `puzzle_input_2.txt`.
Code assumes packages **readr** and **dplyr** are installed.

```R
install.packages(c("readr", "dplyr"))
```
